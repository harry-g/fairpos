= Introduction =

Here you will find a quick start and a list of development tools we are using.

= Quick start =

  # install PostgreSQL V9.0 (_postgresql-9.0.1-1-windows.exe_)
  # create an empty DB "openbravopos" with default settings (must be a fresh, empty DB; if DB exists, e.g. delete and create a new one)
  # restore a DB dump shared from a project member via dropbox
  # remember Postgres user and password!
  # install OpenBravoPOS 2.30.2 (openbravopos-2.30-windows-installer.exe)
  # patch this instalation with recent jar, postgresql-9.0-801.jdbc4.jar, reports and locales from your SVN/IDE or shared from a project member via dropbox
  # modify OpenBravoPOS settings to connect to Postgres DB like this (according to your created DB name and user):

= Installation Jenkins =
 # java -jar jenkins.war
 # open in browser: http://localhost:8080/
 # Jenkins verwalten
 # Als Windows-Dienst installieren
 # Confirm with "Yes"
 # todo: copy plugins, etc.

= Development Process =
  # The ETL process is developed in Talend (project: [https://fairpos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FAIRTRADE/ FAIRTRADE])
  # the ETL process is based on a customer dependent initial DB (manually edited in OpenBravoPOS as needed for the customer)
  # The Java code is developed based on OpenBravoPOS in NetBeans IDE (project: [https://fairpos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OpenBravoPOS/ OpenBravoPOS])
  # OpenBravoPOS installation is patched with the modified parts and connected to a DB filled with the ETL process

= ETL nightly Process =
  # Jenkins runs a nightly job for each supplier
  # This job compares and, if needed, downloads the supplier file (csv, later also images) with a user and pass over HTTP or FTP via e.g. BeyondCompare
  # if the compare tool detected changes, the ETL job of the corresponding supplier is started with the parameters
    * input file, image dir, db url, db user and db pass
