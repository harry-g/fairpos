Here you will find a list of development tools we are using.

= Development Process =
  # The ETL process is developed in Talend (project: FAIRTRADE)
  # The code is then taken and copied into (project: FairPosGo)
  # FairPosGo is exported into a runnable jar which can be used for the transformation

= Runtime Process =
  # Jenkins runs nightly for each supplier a Job
  # This job downloads the supplier file (csv) with a user and pass over HTTP or FTP
  # This file is compared with the latest version of this supplier
  # If the downloaded file is newer than an optional synchronization of the images is started
  # After that the ETL job is startet with the parameters
    # input file, image dir, db url, db user and db pass

= ETL-Synchronization = 
  # Once the database needs to be set up with ETL job
  # every day ETL job downloads the newest article data
  # after that each supplier ETL job is executed
