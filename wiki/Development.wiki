= Introduction =

Here you will find a quick start and a list of development tools we are using.

= Quick start =

  # install PostgreSQL V9.0
  # create an empty DB "openbravopos" with default settings
  # import a DB dump shared from a project member via dropbox
  # remember Postgres user and password!
  # install OpenBravoPOS 2.30.2
  # patch this instalation with recent jar, postgresql-9.0-801.jdbc4.jar, reports and locales from your SVN/IDE or shared from a project member via dropbox
  # modify OpenBravopos settings to connect to Postgres DB (see below)
    * OR alternatively patch settings from a colleague

= Development Process =
  # The ETL process is developed in Talend (project: [https://fairpos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/FAIRTRADE/ FAIRTRADE])
  # the ETL process is based on a customer dependent initial DB (manually edited in OpenBravoPOS as needed for the customer)
  # The Java code is developed based on OpenBravoPOS in NetBeans IDE (project: [https://fairpos.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/OpenBravoPOS/ OpenBravoPOS])
  # OpenBravoPOS installation is patched with the modified parts and connected to a DB filled with the ETL process

= ETL nightly Process =
  # Jenkins runs a nightly job for each supplier
  # This job compares and, if needed, downloads the supplier file (csv, later also images) with a user and pass over HTTP or FTP via e.g. BeyondCompare
  # if the compare tool detected changes, the ETL job of the corresponding supplier is started with the parameters
    * input file, image dir, db url, db user and db pass
